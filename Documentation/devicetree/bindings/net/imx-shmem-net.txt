i.MX SHMEM-NET implementations

A network device to communicate with another domain.
Communication is done through shared memory
 and synchronized by Mailbox Units of imx.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,imx-shmem-net".
- rxfirst: The flag that indicates the position of the RX buffer,
  one of the two partitions must set it.
- mub-partition: The id number of the remote processors,
  used on i.mx8qm for partition reset. The default
  value is 3 in driver without this property.
- power-domains: the power domain of the associated MU.
- memory-region: the coherent memory shared across domains.

=====================================================================
message unit module for SHMEM-NET

- imx_mu_shmem : The message unit module used to do the communications
  between the cores.
- compatible : "fsl,imx-mu-shmem".
- reg : Should contain MU registers location and length.
- interrupts : interrupt mapping for MU IRQ

Example:

imx_mu_shmem: imx_mu_shmem {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-mu-shmem";
	reg = <0x0 0x5d2b0000 0x0 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 202 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clk IMX8QM_LSIO_MU7B_IPG_CLK>;
	clock-names = "ipg";
	power-domains = <&pd_lsio_mu7b>;
	status = "okay";
};

imx_shmem_net: imx_shmem_net {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-shmem-net";
	mub-partition = <1>;
	power-domains = <&pd_lsio_mu7b>;
	memory-region = <&shmem_dma_reserved>;
	status = "disabled";
};

&imx_shmem_net{
	status = "okay";
};
